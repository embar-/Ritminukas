Model parameters:
 
<BRAIN and SAN>
HRbasal – Rate of denervated heart at SAN (beats per minute)
Ssmpt - Theoretically brain sympathetic basal level, practically merged with Arvlm_sp and thus here set to 0
Sparas – Brain parasympathetic basal level
Drsa – Transfer function denominator at NAmb for RSA 
Krsa – RSA coefficient at NAmb
Trsa - Time delay between respiration signal and RSA effect
Arvlm_sp - Theoretically only constant spontaneous RVLM internal activity, practically brain sympathetic basal level is added
Arvlm_mx - Saturation limit of RVML output
Kcvlm - NTS parasympathetic effect on sympathetic activity coefficient at CVLM
Dcvlm - Transfer function denominator at CVLM 
Ks - Sympathetic activity multiplier coefficient at SAN
 
<BARORECEPTION>
Pk - ABP derivative coefficient for baroreception
Kb - Scaling factor of ABP and its derivative sum for baroreception
Peq - Central point of the sigmoidal functional for baroreception
Kab - Slope-related coefficient for baroreception
Bmax - Baroafferent activity saturation level
